windows 11 ethernet Bypass

### What is This
Hello guys.
I installed Windows 11 (arm) on my Macbook
It's have some problems.

one of them was ethernet connection.
I don't see anything to `Active eth driver`

After many search, I found the commands in above file.
Run it as Administrator in you machine and restart it...


:Done
